'''
Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more features and a response by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. Clearly, 
it is nothing but an extension of simple linear regression. It has a dataset with p features(or independent variables) and one response(or dependent variable). 
Also, the dataset contains n rows/observations.

It is to be observed on any dataset having more than one input parameter to predict one output variable which is with continuous value.
