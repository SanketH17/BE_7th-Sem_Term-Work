Linear Regression :
Linear Regression comes under the category of supervised machine learning algorithm. In supervised learning when given a data-set, 
we already know what the correct output should look like, we already have an idea of the relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning broadly covers two types of problems:
Regression problems
Classification problems



Cost Function
It’s important to know how accurate our predictions are in order to know how well our model performs and 
if it needs further“training” or more “tuning” (which is basically adjustment of the parameters). This is where the cost function comes into the picture.

The cost function is an expression through which we evaluate the quality of our current hypothesis and proceed to make changes accordingly.
